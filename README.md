## About
CS590 Blockchain Project : Medical Supply Chain DApp

Our DApp is a Decentralized E2E Logistics Application that stores the whereabouts of medicines at every freight hub on the Blockchain. At customer's end, they can scan the QR CODE of the medicine and get complete information about the product thus empowering them to only purchase authentic medicines
Our application provides the Manufacturers/Pharmacy companies to login and add the product information, the retailers and distributors of the medicines to update the information on the supply - which updates their location and finally the consumers can track the complete product path taken in the supply chain.
